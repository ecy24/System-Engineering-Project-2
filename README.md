# System Engineering Project 2

## Overview

Create a solution that can be attached to a 2D food printer to help Parkinson's disease patients to be capable to enjoying the ability to 2D print their own food.

## System Engineering

For this project, we are looking at the domain of food service where we narrowed down to cafe owners. We look at the Food & Beverage (F&B) 
domain to see what small business owners require to help boost their business in relation to cafes. When looking at the domain we realized 
that small business within the F&B industry want to be able to attract more customers due to the competitiveness of the industry.

### Domain: Food service (cafes)
### Client: Cafe Owners

Need 1: Improve the branding of the cafe by creating a brand that is unique to the cafe.

Need 2: Cafe are willing and open to try out new/emerging technologies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After finding out the high level needs of the cafe owners, we looked up and found that there is a group of customers that is untapped by most 
F&B businesses. The demographics we are targetting would be people with disabilities, specifically peoplle with Parkinson's disease. From our
study, we found out that parkinson's disease patient would generally suffer from tremors which affects them form eating like a normal person
could, thus reducing the impact of tremors would help these patients to eat better and hopefully reduce the social stigma which makes it hard 
for them to eat out.

### Domain: Disability (Parkinson's disease)
### Client: Cafe Owners

Need 1: Machine capable to stabilize the x-axis and y-axis shaking of the tremors.

Need 2: Machine capable of stabilizing the z-axis shaking of the tremors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After looking within the domain, we also found an oppotunity for the cafe to build their campaign around and develop itself as an inclusive cafe 
where its a safe space for those with Parkinson's disease to be capable of enjoying eating out. We also think that our product which could include 
a latte art printer could allow the customers' of this cafe to enjoy creating their own latte art even if they suffer from parkinson's disease.

## Project Management

For this project, agile is use to iterate the solution to ensure that each iteration of the project is better than its previous. Also, because 
its impossible to target the entire food service domain and all people with different kinds of disability, scope management for the project is 
important.
